**Risk Level:** üî¥ **HIGH** - Multiple compliance deficiencies require immediate attention.

---

## 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Missing Legal Documents

### 1.1 Terms of Service (ToS)

**Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**  
**Risk:** **HIGH**

**Current State:**

- Auth.vue references "terms of service" (line 121) but no actual document exists
- Users have no contractual framework for platform use
- No limitation of liability protections
- No dispute resolution mechanisms

**Required Actions:**

- [ ] Create comprehensive Terms of Service document covering:
  - User responsibilities and prohibited conduct
  - Intellectual property rights (user content vs. platform IP)
  - Service availability and disclaimers
  - Limitation of liability
  - Termination and account suspension policies
  - Dispute resolution (arbitration clauses, jurisdiction)
  - Changes to terms notification
- [ ] Add enforceable "I Agree" checkbox on registration (not just reference text)
- [ ] Store agreement acceptance timestamp with user account
- [ ] Version control for ToS changes with notification system

**Code Reference:**

```121:121:src/views/Auth.vue
            By signing in, you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy
```

### 1.2 Privacy Policy

**Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**  
**Risk:** **HIGH - GDPR/CCPA Violation**

**Current State:**

- No privacy policy document exists
- Platform collects extensive user data (authentication, profiles, voice samples, preferences)
- Uses localStorage extensively without disclosure
- Third-party integrations (Google OAuth, Firebase) without privacy disclosures

**Required Actions:**

- [ ] Create comprehensive Privacy Policy covering:
  - **Data Collection:** What data you collect (PII, voice recordings, payment info)
  - **Data Usage:** How data is used (profile display, matching, analytics)
  - **Data Sharing:** Third-party services (Google, Firebase, payment processors)
  - **Data Storage:** Where data is stored, retention periods
  - **User Rights:** Access, deletion, export (GDPR Article 15-20, CCPA Section 1798.100)
  - **Cookies/LocalStorage:** Disclosure of storage mechanisms
  - **Security Measures:** Data protection safeguards
  - **International Transfers:** If data crosses borders (GDPR Article 44-49)
  - **Contact Information:** Data Protection Officer (if required) or privacy contact
- [ ] Link privacy policy prominently in:

---

## 2. üîí Data Protection Compliance

### 2.1 GDPR Compliance (European Users)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**  
**Risk:** **HIGH**

**Current Implementation:**

- Data export functionality exists (`DataExport.vue`)
- Account deletion exists but only clears localStorage (incomplete)
- No explicit consent mechanisms
- No data processing legal basis disclosure

**Missing Requirements:**

1. **Consent Management (GDPR Article 7)**
   - [ ] Cookie consent banner before any cookies/localStorage are set
   - [ ] Granular consent options (analytics, marketing, necessary cookies)
   - [ ] Consent withdrawal mechanism
   - [ ] Record consent with timestamp

2. **Data Subject Rights (GDPR Articles 15-20)**
   - [ ] **Right to Access (Article 15):** Implement user dashboard showing all personal data
   - [ ] **Right to Rectification (Article 16):** Edit profile functionality exists, ensure it covers all data
   - [ ] **Right to Erasure (Article 17):** Current deletion only clears localStorage; must delete from backend servers
   - [ ] **Right to Data Portability (Article 20):** Export function exists but ensure it includes ALL data
   - [ ] **Right to Object (Article 21):** Mechanism to object to processing

3. **Data Processing Legal Basis**
   - [ ] Identify and document legal basis for each data processing activity
   - [ ] Display legal basis in privacy policy
   - [ ] Consent for marketing, legitimate interest for service provision

4. **Data Protection by Design (GDPR Article 25)**
   - [ ] Minimize data collection (only collect what's necessary)
   - [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - [ ] Implement access controls

**Code Issues:**

```92:104:src/components/molecules/TalentSettings/DataExport.vue
const handleDeleteAccount = () => {
  if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete your account? This action cannot be undone.')) {
    // Clear all localStorage data
    localStorage.removeItem('voiceact-onboarding-data')
    localStorage.removeItem('voiceact-profile-data')
    localStorage.removeItem('voiceact-settings')
    localStorage.removeItem('voiceact-voice-samples')
    localStorage.removeItem('voiceact-onboarding-completed')

    success('Account deleted successfully')
    router.push('/')
  }
}
```

**Problem:** Only deletes from localStorage, not from backend servers. This violates GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure).

**Required Fix:**

- Make API call to backend to delete all user data from servers
- Delete associated media files
- Delete related records (job applications, submissions, etc.)
- Confirm deletion completion before showing success message

### 2.2 CCPA Compliance (California Users)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**  
**Risk:** **MEDIUM**

**Requirements:**

- [ ] Privacy policy (Section 1798.100)
- [ ] "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link (if applicable - Section 1798.135)
- [ ] Opt-out mechanisms for data sales (if you sell data)
- [ ] Non-discrimination for exercising rights (Section 1798.125)
- [ ] User access to personal information (similar to GDPR access rights)

**Note:** If revenue exceeds $25M or processes data of 50,000+ consumers, full CCPA applies.

### 2.3 Cookie Consent

**Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**  
**Risk:** **HIGH - GDPR/ePrivacy Directive Violation**

**Current State:**

- Platform uses localStorage extensively without consent
- Uses third-party authentication (Google OAuth) which sets cookies
- No cookie consent banner or mechanism

**Required Actions:**

- [ ] Implement cookie consent banner before any cookies/localStorage are set
- [ ] Categorize cookies:
  - **Necessary:** Authentication, security (no consent needed)
  - **Functional:** Preferences, settings
  - **Analytics:** Usage tracking (requires consent)
  - **Marketing:** Advertising (requires consent)
- [ ] Allow users to opt-in/opt-out of non-essential cookies
- [ ] Store consent preferences
- [ ] Provide cookie settings page for managing preferences

**Regulatory Requirements:**

- **EU ePrivacy Directive:** Requires consent for non-essential cookies
- **GDPR:** Cookie consent must be freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous

## 3. üë∂ Age Restrictions & COPPA Compliance

**Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**  
**Risk:** **HIGH - Federal Violation (US)**

### 3.1 Current State

- No age verification on registration
- No terms specifying minimum age
- Platform facilitates professional contracts (may require 18+)

### 3.2 COPPA Requirements (Children Under 13 - US)

If platform knowingly collects data from children under 13:

- [ ] Age gate on registration
- [ ] Parental consent mechanism
- [ ] Minimal data collection from children
- [ ] Privacy policy specific to children
- [ ] Data deletion upon parent request

### 3.3 GDPR Age Requirements (EU)

- **Age of Consent:** Varies by country (13-16)

- [ ] Parental consent for users below age of consent

### 3.4 Recommended Actions

- [ ] Add minimum age requirement (likely 18+ for professional contracts)
- [ ] Age verification checkbox/input on registration
- [ ] Terms should explicitly state minimum age
- [ ] Block registration if age requirement not met

---

## 4. ‚ôø Accessibility Compliance (ADA)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**  
**Risk:** **MEDIUM**

### 4.1 Current Implementation

- Some ARIA labels present (Button component)
- Keyboard navigation partially implemented
- Screen reader support mentioned in docs

### 4.2 ADA/WCAG Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance recommended (legal standard in many jurisdictions):**

- [ ] **Perceivable:**
  - [ ] Alt text for all images (Icon component uses `aria-hidden`, may need labels)
  - [ ] Sufficient color contrast (test with WCAG contrast checker)
  - [ ] Text alternatives for audio/video content

- [ ] **Operable:**
  - [ ] Full keyboard navigation (all interactive elements)
  - [ ] Skip navigation links
  - [ ] No keyboard traps
  - [ ] Sufficient time limits for timed interactions

- [ ] **Understandable:**
  - [ ] Clear error messages
  - [ ] Form labels and instructions
  - [ ] Consistent navigation

- [ ] **Robust:**
  - [ ] Valid HTML markup
  - [ ] Proper ARIA attributes
  - [ ] Screen reader compatibility testing

**Code Review:**

```46:47:src/components/atoms/Button.vue
    <!-- Fallback for accessibility -->
    <span v-else class="sr-only">Button</span>
```

Good: Fallback text exists, but ensure all buttons have meaningful labels.

**Required Actions:**

- [ ] Conduct full accessibility audit (automated + manual testing)
- [ ] Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Fix all WCAG 2.1 Level AA violations
- [ ] Add accessibility statement to footer

**Legal Risk:** ADA Title III requires websites to be accessible to individuals with disabilities. Recent case law (e.g., Domino's Pizza v. Guillermo Robles) establishes website accessibility obligations.
