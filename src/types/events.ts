/**
 * Event channels and payload types for the global event bus.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Central place to declare event names and payload contracts
 * - Document who publishes and who consumes each channel
 * - Keep string literals stable to prevent accidental API changes
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Import a channel and payload type, then use VueUse: `useEventBus<Payload>(CHANNEL)`
 * - See `docs/event-bus.md` for patterns and guidance. The canonical event list lives here.
